# Introduction
A solo project building a CRUD application using tools and methodologies used during QA Academy training, due to present at the beginning of week 6. 

My project is an application designed to use different types of instrumental music to aid studying depending on users' personality. 

# The Brief



# Technology Used
## Initial Entitiy Relationship Diagram
ERDiagrams were used to help organise the database.

Below is the initial ERDiagram making use of the MoSCoW principle, ensuring to focus on areas that should be in the application with the help of the user stories.

## Final Entitiy Relationship Diagram

Initially I wanted to include the playlist table so that songs could be saved into a playlist for ease of use. However, due to time constraints, I decided to only use 2 tables linked with a one to many relationship.
